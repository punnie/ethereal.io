description: How to deploy your own email server

Back in the 9th of May I did a little talk/workshop at [Porto Codes](https://porto.codes/previous.html#2019-05-09) where I talked about the advantages and perils of owning your own email server, the hassles with spam and protecting your domain from being flagged as an origin, and so forth.

Halfway through I did a live demo where I installed a postfix/dovecot server from a clean Ubuntu installation. The purpose of this exercise was to demonstrate how easily and fast it could be done. Sure enough, I was done in less than 15 minutes, as it is indeed an easy task.

Since then I had some people asking me about the script that I followed for that demo, so it is now available [here](https://ethereal.io/sneakermail/).

Happy emailing!
