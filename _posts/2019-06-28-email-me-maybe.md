description: How to deploy your own email server

Back in the 9th of May I did a little talk/workshop at [Porto Codes](https://porto.codes/previous.html#2019-05-09) where I talked about the advantages and perils of owning your own email server.

Halfway through I did a live demo where I installed a postfix and dovecot server from a clean Ubuntu installation. This exercise's purpose was to demonstrate how easy and fast it could be done. Sure enough, I was done in less than 15 minutes, as it is indeed an easy task.

Since then I had some people asking me about the script that I followed for that demo. It's available [here](https://ethereal.io/sneakermail/).

Happy emailing!
